Welcome to my Virtual Work Experience page. Here you will find the Cybersecurity programs I have completed through Forage. Forage is an online platform offering self-paced virtual work experience programs that simulate the tasks and scenarios professionals encounter in the cybersecurity field.

On this page you will find links to each Cybersecurity program I undertook, where you can read my write-ups in more detail. Each has the objectives I worked towards, the challenges address and techniques applied to develop solutions.

Feel free to explore each module to see how I've built practical Cybersecurity skills through these experiences!
