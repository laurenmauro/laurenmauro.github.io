G'day! My name is Lauren,  a 2nd year Bachelor of Cybersecurity student at the University of Technology Sydney. My technical skills span Windows and macOS adminstration, basic Active Directory and packet-level troubleshooting with Wireshark. My recent help-desk internship at Navitas let me close Jira tickets for hardware, software and connectivity issues, roll out classroom equipment and shadow senior technicians on more complex issues.

To improve the skills I've learnt at both uni and my internship, I have been undertaking projects and mini-certs. In CyberCX's Cyber5050 program, I was selected as one of 30 women in NSW/ACT to cover core Cybersecurity topics such as threat actors, incident response and cloud security. I have also been undertaking Forage virtual work experience courses; one which was particularly interesting was Commonwealth Bank's, giving me hands-on experience in Splunk, incident respose and penetration testing.

Outside of my Cybersecurity work, you can find me tutoring English for Primary and High-school students, translating technicalities into easy to understand language. I am also passionate about fragrance, writing my honest reviews on different perfumes in my collection, which boasts over 20 bottles.

Based in Sydney, I am exploring career paths where I can use my communication skills for good - particularly Governance, Risk and Compliance, Cyber consultancy and potentially defense SOC roles.

Feel free to explore my projects and say hello via [Linkedin!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-mauro-325853269/) I am open to any feedback or comments. 

Thanks for viewing my portfolio!
